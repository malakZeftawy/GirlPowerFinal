And in the up coming years we will have more achievements to be proud of because you girls are THE FUTURE! 
You have to know  that without your existance in this world men would never be able to pursue their lives, you are a part of theirs and you have your own dreams that you should go after them you can do both at the same time beacause <strong>YOU CAN DO IT </strong> 

Hopefully , we have people that encourages girls of the 21th centuries to practice jobs that were meant for "only men" beacuse they the "genius ones" such as Vodafone who is running a STEM youth program to discover the world of the computer science , you get to learn how to <strong> CODE LIKE A GIRL!! </strong>
