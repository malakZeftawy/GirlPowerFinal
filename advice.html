<h2 id="t1"> <center> HOW YOU GIRLS CAN FIGHT TO STOP IT..?! </center> </h2>
<center> <p class="intro">  Women of the world…the daughters, the mothers, the aunts, the wives, the grandmothers, the sisters, the soul sisters, the ultimate nurturers..get UP and embrace your inner awesomeness! It’s time to empower yourselves!

Empowered is a word that gets said way too much, even though many people do not understand exactly what it means. Women, often want to be known as empowered. The idea of being an empowered woman implies that you are in control of your life. There is a bit of feminism in this, but truly many women want to feel that they are empowered and in control of their lives. The question is how do you get there? What makes an empowered woman? If these are the questions that you have been asking yourself, then you will want to keep reading.

Every woman has the ability to take charge of her life with grace, strength, and confidence—including you. That’s right, the power to be happy and fulfilled lies in your own hands. So why not live the life of your dreams? It may be easier than you think.

Here are some simple positive tips to get you started ….. </p> </center>
<center> <ul>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Know Yourself </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp1"> An empowered woman knows who she is. Many women today feel as though they have lost themselves. Maybe they gave too much in a relationship that didn’t work out. Maybe they put too much time into work and not enough time into themselves. Maybe they feel lost in the challenges of motherhood. Regardless, many women need to spend some time getting to know themselves. Knowing yourself goes way beyond what you do or who you are. Knowing yourself means understanding your own strengths and weaknesses. Do you work best by yourself or on a team? Do you communicate well? Are you organized? Are you a leader? These are questions that the empowered woman knows the answers to, because the empowered woman understands who she is as a person.
 </p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Keep Learning </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp2"> Never ever stop learning. Freeing and expanding your mind is one of the most imperative step toward empowering yourself, so educate yourself in any way you can. Even if you don’t have a formal education there are still plenty of ways to increase your knowledge on your own. Taking the initiative to teach yourself something new is one of the most empowering things you can do. Read books, go to the library or a bookstore, join a book club, or do research on the Internet. Why not sign up for a class that interests you? It can be as simple as knitting or as complex as physics. The point is to explore an area you have never explored before. Look for weekend workshops in your newspaper or drop by your local institutes to see what classes they have to offer. And if you are a busy mom with no time to take a class, check out an educational book from the library and read a few pages before bed each night. A smart woman is an empowered woman. 
</p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Know What YOU Want </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp3"> An empowered woman knows what she wants. This means that she has goals and dreams for her life. They may or may not include marriage, a family, or rising up the career ladder. Regardless of what the goals are, the empowered woman knows what she wants out of life. This enables her to act in ways that will move her closer to these goals. If she has a goal of getting married, then she will date with that goal in mind. If she has a goal of advancing in her career, then she will work with the idea of earning an eventual promotion. No matter what the goals are, having them clearly mentally defined enables the empowered woman to go after what she wants. Are you going after what you want?
</p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Be Independent </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp4"> When was the last time you left your house without your cell phone? Have you ever gone to a restaurant and had dinner all alone with just your awesome self for company? Being comfortable with who you are, and knowing that you are strong enough to face any situation on your own, is an empowering feeling. It doesn’t matter whether you have a partner or not. Enjoying YOU time hypes your spirit in countless ways. Don’t let not having a partner or special someone to share things with stop you from doing everything you want to do. Treat yourself to a movie or a weekend getaway for one. Make it a goal to try something new that you wouldn’t normally do alone. While you’re out there living it up you’ll be building confidence and increasing your chances of knowing yourself better.
</p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Make Connections </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp5"> An empowered woman makes deep connections, both personal and professional. This means that she knows people, but it goes deeper than that. The empowered woman has a network of people that she has relationships with and can count on. They may be business relationships or personal ones, but she knows that she can count on these people. The business relationships may be people she can count on to help with a project or give honest feedback. The personal relationships may be friends that she can rely on when she needs them. The connections that an empowered woman makes are with people whom she can help and who can intern help her to become a better person.
</p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Give Back </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp6"> When you help others, you help yourself. Give back to the community in any way you can and you will be rewarded in more ways than one. Try volunteering one day a week for a program you really believe in. Find a charity you want to support, help with events around the holidays, or organize your own community program. Volunteering is not the only way to get involved with your community. Watching your neighbor’s kids or helping a friend in need is just as big a contribution. Giving back does not have to be a grand gesture. It’s as simple as saying good morning and holding the door for someone. Open your heart to others and they will open theirs to you. What a positively empowering act..right!
</p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Dream Big </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp7"> Don’t be afraid to go after your dreams. No dream is too big or unobtainable. An empowered woman knows that she can accomplish anything she sets out to do, it is simply a matter of perseverance, believing in yourself, and following your heart. If you truly believe in your dreams you can make them happen. But in order to do this you must try. Consider making a vision board to illustrate and remind yourself of all the goals you would like to accomplish. Listen to your heart. It was put there to empower you.
</p>
    <li> <h3 id="t1"> Empower Others </h3> </li>
    <p class="tp8"> An empowered woman empowers others. This is maybe the most difficult but most rewarding of all. An empowered woman can encourage other women to strive for what they want. She doesn’t pull people down but instead helps them to discover their full potential. This enables her to contribute positively to the lives of other women that she knows.
