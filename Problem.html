<h2 id="t1"> <center> WHAT GIRL POWER IS ..? </center> </h2>
<center> <p class="def"> 
Girl Power is global movement committed to the empowerment of women, girls and youth through leadership training, mentorship. We support philanthropic projects locally and around the world and envision a world where positive change spreads globally from one person to another. Our aim is to inspire global change by bringing together communities of mindful leaders to initiate dialogue, participation and activism. It is also a pop culture motto used to stitch feminism into young girls/teenagers. Supposed to promote sexual equality, even though it suggests that females have superior rights to males. Frequently used by females to annoy egalitarian males who try to keep everyone's voice and rights at an equal. My opinion: <strong>EVERYONE</strong> is equal, so Girl Power and Men's Health <strong>BOTH</strong> go to hell. Girl power is a clever advertising tactic that has become mainstream is to manipulate the message that many feminists have tried to promote: Girls have the power to be anything we want, including the president, if only we use our voice and ideas. Advertisers and other media have reinterpreted this idea as "Girl Power," which tells girls we can wear anything we want and no one can tell us otherwise. In this interpretation, power has nothing to do with character or achievement but is instead the result of having a perfect body and not being afraid to show it off.
Many movies and television shows feature "powerful" characters that are in-your-face, aggressive, kick-butt women. But these action heroines dress in skintight clothes, if they bother to wear any, and are almost all white and thin with big breasts. They are nothing more than male fantasy objects that Hollywood constructed, cleverly co-opting the language of feminism. The notion that sexuality and promiscuity equal power and control is particularly perilous for girls navigating our way to adulthood.

<h2 id="t1" > <center> THE PROBLEM </center> </h2>
<center> <p class="pb1"> 
Girls. Alone, they are strong. Together, they are unstoppable. We are born into a society where a girl is considered weak, fragile, or delicate. All around the world girls are under estimated on their strength, intelligence, and their political opinions. This world needs to change perspective on how they view girls worlwide. The comparisons to men need to stop, the mocking of women needs to stop, and comparing girls to ther girls need to stop; because evry body shape, hair color, eye color, and weight is perfect.
